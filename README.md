# Housing Price Prediction Analysis

## Executive Summary
This analysis utilizes an OLS model to predict housing prices in Bangkok and its vicinity, focusing on three property types: Condos, Detached Houses, and Townhouses. The objective is to evaluate which investment offers better returns: real estate or stocks. Our findings reveal that while Bangkok properties command higher prices, location, size, and accessibility significantly influence property values. Notably, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan have lower prices but are impacted by developments like the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC).

## Key Insights
- **Location Matters:** Properties in Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan are generally cheaper compared to Bangkok, yet the EEC may boost future values of Samut Prakan.
- **Size and Functionality:** Property characteristics must align with market demand. Townhouses tend to be less valuable than Condos, and Detached Houses also show decreased values.
- **Accessibility:** Proximity to public transport stations correlates with higher property prices.

## OLS Regression Model

## Understanding the Model
This model helps us understand what factors affect property prices in the area. It explains about **51.7%** of the differences in prices based on various features of the properties.

## Key Factors Increasing Property Prices
- **Bedrooms**: More bedrooms mean higher prices. Each extra bedroom adds about **33,600 THB** to the property price.
- **Bathrooms**: Having more bathrooms is even more valuable. Each additional bathroom increases the price by about **90,000 THB**.
- **Land Area**: More land increases the price slightly—about **6,100 THB** for every extra square meter.
- **Floor Area**: Each extra square meter of floor space adds about **8,600 THB** to the price.
- **Nearby Supermarkets**: Each additional supermarket nearby adds roughly **84,900 THB** to the property value.
- **Nearby Stations**: Having more public transport options nearby increases the property value by about **57,420 THB** for each additional station.
- **Year Built**: Newer properties are worth more. For each year newer, the price goes up by about **39,200 THB**.
- **Floor Level**: Higher floors add value too—about **31,500 THB** for each level up.
- **Facilities**: More amenities (like a gym or pool) also increase prices, adding about **60,400 THB** for each additional facility.

## Location Matters
- **Nonthaburi**: Properties here are generally worth less, with a decrease of about **98,270 THB** compared to properties in Bangkok.

- **Property Types**: 
  - **Townhouses**: These associated with a price reduction about **168,590 THB** less than Condo

# Conclusion
In simple terms, this analysis shows that the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and nearby amenities significantly increase property prices.
